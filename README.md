# Map Solver
It is a simple program which will be used to solve maps/mazes as it is a necessity in everyones day to day life to go from point A to point B without wasting time on inefficient routes
## Things Left
-City Planner - A city/area is mapped for the real time usage of this project.   
-Maze Solving Algorithmn - A maze solving algorithmn (most probably A*) to solve the problem of not getting inefficient paths.

## Things Done
-Graphics Library - A library to create an app which has the ability to draw on a window (raylib python version)  
-Maze Generation - A maze generation algorithmn (sidewinder algorithmn) to create a perfect maze where every spot is accessible to showcase the true potentional of this project.
